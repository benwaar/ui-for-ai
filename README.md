# UI for AI Quickstart: Agents, Chatbots & DMI Reporting

This is a learning lab. The aim is to give a skilled UI developer the principles to read and the study plan to work through, before starting work on a UI for AI project. 

It is also useful for testing out different dev tooling options for writing accessible UX for AI projects [docs/ai-tools-for-ui-a11y.md](docs/ai-tools-for-ui-a11y.md).
